# 🥛 SpyltMilk Clone

A **modern frontend clone** of the [Awwwards SOTD-winning website Spylt.com](https://www.spylt.com/) — originally designed by Tubik Studio.  
Built to demonstrate my skills in **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP animation**, focusing on fluid scroll effects, interactive UI, and responsive design.

## 🧠 About the Project
This project is a **frontend clone** of [Spylt.com](https://www.spylt.com/), which won **Site of the Day (SOTD)** on [Awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/).  
I recreated it to sharpen my animation and modern web development skills — exploring **smooth transitions, scroll-based effects, and layout responsiveness**.
